Practical hands-on exercises will be emphasised throughout the course to build up participants R experience. No prior knowledge of R is necessary, although participants should be comfortable using computers to handle data sets in statistical software (such as SPSS or Stata) and spreadsheets (such as Excel). Upon completion of this course, students will be familiar with the R environment, its basic functions and more advanced methods from some of the most popular R packages for importing, manipulating and visualising data.\n## Courses in this program  The course involves five sections:\n An introduction to R, including basic R functions, accessing R packages and using RStudio effectively. Visualising data in R using the ggplot2 package, including basic charts, facet plots and maps. Creating simple dynamic visualisations such as animations and interactive plots using the gganimate and shiny packages. Managing demographic data in R using the tidyverse suite of packages, including reading data of different formats into R and summarising, combining and reshaping data within R. Using R markdown to efficiently turn your analyses into high quality documents, reports and presentations. Students will gain experience in each of these areas through lectures interspersed with practical computing exercises and homework assignments. Besides experience of handling data using statistical software, participants should also have a basic knowledge of demography, mathematics and statistics.

We created a global dataset of annual net migration between 2000 and 2019 (~10 km grid, covering the areas of 216 countries or sovereign states), based on reported and downscaled subnational birth (2,555 administrative units) and death (2,067 administrative units) rates. We show that, globally, around 50% of the world’s urban population lived in areas where migration accelerated urban population growth, while a third of the global population lived in provinces where rural areas experienced positive net migration. Finally, we show that, globally, socioeconomic factors are more strongly associated with migration patterns than climatic factors. While our method is dependent on census data, incurring notable uncertainties in regions where census data coverage or quality is low, we were able to capture migration patterns not only between but also within countries, as well as by socioeconomic and geophysical zonings. Our results highlight the importance of subnational analysis of migration—a necessity for policy design, international cooperation and shared responsibility for managing internal and international migration.","tags":null,"title":"World’s human migration patterns in 2000–2019 unveiled by high-resolution data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert M.

Quantitative models exploring the relationship between climatic factors and migration patterns have been developed since the early 2000s; however, different models have produced results that are not always consistent with one another or robust enough to provide actionable insights into future dynamics. Here we examine weaknesses of classical methods and identify next-generation approaches with the potential to close existing knowledge gaps. We propose six priorities for the future of climate mobility modeling: (i) the use of non-linear machine-learning rather than linear methods, (ii) the prioritization of explaining the observed data rather than testing statistical significance of predictors, (iii) the consideration of relevant climate impacts rather than temperature- and precipitation-based metrics, (iv) the examination of heterogeneities, including across space and demographic groups rather than aggregated measures, (v) the investigation of temporal migration dynamics rather than essentially spatial patterns, (vi) the use of better calibration data, including disaggregated and within-country flows. Improving both methods and data to accommodate the high complexity and context-specificity of climate mobility will be crucial for establishing the scientific consensus on historical trends and future projections that has eluded the discipline thus far.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling climate migration: dead ends and new avenues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elin Charles-Edwards","Aude Bernard","Francisco Rowe","Guy J.

The impact of migration on population distribution is a function of both the intensity as well as the effectiveness of migration, that is the imbalance between flows and counter-flows. The presence of reciprocal flows is a well-recognized feature of international migration systems; however, this dimension has been difficult to capture at the global level due to a lack of origin-destination flow data. In this research note, we apply metrics developed for the analysis of internal migration to global migration flows to explore the impact of international migration on global population distribution over time, and across levels of human development. In the five years to 2020, international migration redistributed 0.39 percent of the world's population (28 million people) despite 1.38 percent (101 million) changing country of residence. This has declined from 0.56 percent of the global population in 1990–1995. This decline in impact is underpinned by a reduction in migration effectiveness, that is, the migration system is becoming more balanced over time. The impact of migration was greatest for flows between countries at Very High levels of human development, reflecting high migration intensity and exchanges between countries at Low and Very High levels of human development, reflecting significant asymmetry of flows. Our results suggest systematic shifts in both the level and pattern of flows across the development ladder, with flows becoming more intense and balanced with higher levels of human development.","tags":null,"title":"International Migration and Development: The Changing Impact of Migration on Redistributing Global Population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nayoung Heo","Hsin-Chieh Chang","Guy J.

One of the main contributing factors to the impact of universities on local development is the size of alumni that remain after graduation. In recent years, new data sources have emerged from social media that can potentially provide more timely and unique estimates of population redistribution. We use LinkedIn advertising platform data to measure alumni population distributions in South Korea and Taiwan. In both countries, there are decreasing numbers of students entering universities, with potential negative impacts on local development. We validated the LinkedIn data using external comparisons of totals against official data on the distribution of tertiary-educated populations and university student population sizes. We use multi-level gravity models to compare and contrast the spatial distributions of the alumni networks in the two countries, and the related push and pull factors. The data from LinkedIn provide plausible measures of alumni networks and an insight into the potential drivers of alumni population distributions. The results provide useful guidance on the potential impacts when reorganizing university systems in the coming decades.","tags":null,"title":"Investigating the distribution of university alumni populations within South Korea and Taiwan based on data from the LinkedIn advertising platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guy Abel"],"categories":["R","population","demography","treemap","r-bloggers","r-weekly"],"content":"Background The global population hit 8 billion today.

To understand the geographic dynamics of the Chinese population migration, we present a revised method called the migration centerline based on the definition of the geographic mean center of the population. Using data from the population censuses and one-percent sample surveys from 1995 to 2015, this study aims to reveal the spatial dynamics and contributors to population movements in China. The main results are as follows. (1) The directions of the population migration centerlines consistently point southeast, while the in- and out-migration centers for the five-year and non-hukou population migrations move north, especially from 2000 to 2010. After 2010, the west-oriented movements of the in-migration centers become pronounced, and migration distances generally decline. Five-year population migration towards the north increases from 2010 to 2015, whereas the non-hukou populations increased in the south in 2015. (2) The main contributors to in-migration centers are the coastal provinces, whereas out-migration centers are mostly inland provinces. (3) The geographic transformation of population migration centerlines is connected to changes in China's economic and population centers, moving south, leading to stable southeast-oriented migrations. In addition, the locations of migration centerlines are consistently further south compared with those of population centers. The migration centerline provides an intuitive and straightforward means for examining the geographic transformation of China's internal population migration and can be applied to various types of human mobilities based on different definitions or multiple spatial scales.","tags":null,"title":"Geographic transformation of China's internal population migration from 1995 to 2015: Insights from the migration centerline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guy Abel"],"categories":["R","football","chord diagram","r-bloggers","r-weekly"],"content":"I have been playing around with rvest once again, and decided to extend some old code to put together a data base on the squads at past European Championships from Wikipedia.

The countries are ordered by the groups that they will play in during the first round (in the animation below I order the teams by their first appearance at a tournament). The countries at the top of the diagram with no flags are leagues where the national team are not represented at the tournament, but some of clubs have players representing other national teams.\nThe chords coming out of each sector are ordered by size - it’s interesting to see more Austrian than German players playing in German leagues, and more Welsh than English players playing in English leagues.\nI adapted some code from animated migration chord diagrams to provide a history of the relationships between the club leagues of the players and the national team squads at each European Championship. In most of the early tournaments almost all the players came from clubs in their home country.

My favorite examples of Sankey plots for migration data tend to be when there are only few regions or countries. As the number of regions or countries increases the plot become more cumbersome, where labels for the smaller areas get too small and the plotting area becomes a very long rectangle making it awkward to fit on paper or view on the screen. In such cases I prefer chord diagrams\nThe recent highlights document for the UN international migration stock data contained a couple of Sankey plots for the data in 2020. In this post I have created animated versions of one of the plots in the report to show changes in migrant distributions between 1990 and 2020 by World Bank income groups.

There are a few packages in R that have functions for Sankey plots, for example sankey, PantaRhei, networkD3, sankeywheel, plotly and ggsankey. The ggalluvial packages also produces Sankey-type plots, but without spaces between each sector. I used ggforce because it is pretty easy to tweak the non-Sankey parts of the plot using ggplot functions, and I had hoped that it would play well with gganimate - which it didn\u0026rsquo;t, hence the use of tweenr - but perhaps one day it will.\nPlots The first animated plot shows the changes over time where the y-axis increases as the migrant populations grow larger.

We show that return migrants account for a significant share of in-migration flows, particularly in Africa and Latin America, and, in all countries but six, return migrants are more educated than the population in the migrants’ country of birth. Our age decomposition reveals that young adults contribute the most to the positive educational selectivity of return migrants, particularly in Africa and Asia.

Because of their high temporal granularity, many migration estimates can be generated from the same data set by changing the definition parameters. Yet despite the growing application of digital trace data to migration research, strategies for taking advantage of their temporal granularity remain largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we provide a general framework for converting digital trace data into estimates of migration transitions and for systematically analyzing their variation along a quasi-continuous time scale, analogous to a survival function. From migration theory, we develop two simple hypotheses regarding how we expect our estimated migration transition functions to behave. We then test our hypotheses on simulated data and empirical data from three platforms in two internal migration contexts: geotagged Tweets and Gowalla check-ins in the United States, and cell-phone call detail records in Senegal. Our results demonstrate the need for evaluating the internal consistency of migration estimates derived from digital trace data before using them in substantive research. At the same time, however, common patterns across our three empirical data sets point to an emergent research agenda using digital trace data to study the specific functional relationship between estimates of migration and time and how this relationship varies by geography and population characteristics.","tags":null,"title":"Analyzing the Effect of Time in Migration Measurement Using Geo-referenced Digital Trace Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guy Abel"],"categories":["R","r-bloggers"],"content":"\rIntroduction The tidycat package includes the tidy_categorical() function to expand broom::tidy() outputs for categorical parameter estimates.\nDocumentation For full documentation, see the package vignette: The tidycat package: expand broom::tidy() output for categorical parameter estimates\nHello World The tidy() function in the broom package takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm(), and turns them into tidy data frames.\nlibrary(dplyr)\rlibrary(broom)\rm1 \u0026lt;- mtcars %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(transmission = recode_factor(am, `0` = \u0026quot;automatic\u0026quot;, `1` = \u0026quot;manual\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;%\rlm(mpg ~ transmission + wt * as.factor(cyl), data = .)\rtidy(m1)\r ## # A tibble: 7 x 5\r## term estimate std.error statistic p.value\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 (Intercept) 41.5 4.54 9.14 0.00000000190\r## 2 transmissionmanual -0.902 1.51 -0.595 0.557 ## 3 wt -6.19 1.65 -3.75 0.000937 ## 4 as.factor(cyl)6 -8.66 10.4 -0.836 0.411 ## 5 as.factor(cyl)8 -16.9 5.27 -3.20 0.00374 ## 6 wt:as.factor(cyl)6 2.12 3.40 0.625 0.538 ## 7 wt:as.factor(cyl)8 3.84 1.77 2.17 0.0399\r The tidy_categorical() function adds\n further columns (variable, level and effect) to the broom::tidy() output to help manage categorical variables further rows for reference category terms and a column to indicate their location (reference) when setting include_reference = TRUE (default)  It requires two inputs\n a data frame d of parameter estimates from a model from broom::tidy() the corresponding model object m passed to broom::tidy()  For example:\nlibrary(tidycat)\rd1 \u0026lt;- m1 %\u0026gt;%\rtidy(conf.int = TRUE) %\u0026gt;%\rtidy_categorical(m = m1)\rd1 %\u0026gt;%\rselect(-(3:5))\r ## # A tibble: 10 x 8\r## term estimate conf.low conf.high variable level effect reference ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 (Interce~ 41.5 32.1 50.8 (Intercept) (Inte~ main Non-Baselin~\r## 2 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 0 0 transmissi~ autom~ main Baseline Ca~\r## 3 transmis~ -0.902 -4.02 2.22 transmissi~ manual main Non-Baselin~\r## 4 wt -6.19 -9.59 -2.79 wt wt main Non-Baselin~\r## 5 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 0 0 as.factor(~ 4 main Baseline Ca~\r## 6 as.facto~ -8.66 -30.0 12.7 as.factor(~ 6 main Non-Baselin~\r## 7 as.facto~ -16.9 -27.7 -6.00 as.factor(~ 8 main Non-Baselin~\r## 8 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 0 0 wt:as.fact~ 4 intera~ Baseline Ca~\r## 9 wt:as.fa~ 2.12 -4.87 9.12 wt:as.fact~ 6 intera~ Non-Baselin~\r## 10 wt:as.fa~ 3.84 0.192 7.50 wt:as.fact~ 8 intera~ Non-Baselin~\r The expanded data frame from tidy_categorical() of parameter estimates can be particularly useful for creating coefficient plots, allowing:\n grouping terms from the same categorical variable from the additional columns. inclusion of reference categories in a coefficient plot from the additional rows, allowing the reader to better grasp the meaning of the parameter estimates in each categorical variable.

In the first plot I keep the sector axis fixed at their maximums (over both sexes) making it easier to detect changes in the relative volume of a particular migrant corridor; for example the greater number of male migrants in West Asia and slightly more female migrants in North America.\n\rIn the second plot, I allow the sector axis to be specific to the regional totals. This (perhaps?) makes it easier to detect relative changes in the overall global patterns by sex.\n\r\nMigrant populations relative to total populations One important feature of international migrants are their relative rarity. Professor Hein de Haas visually illustrates this point neatly using a pie chart, where his focus is predominantly on refugees, but also clearly shows the small share of the global population that are living outside their country of birth (under 4%). This feature is completely missed in the migrant chord diagrams above, where there is no way to gauge the share of the migrant populations relative to the total population. In the plot below I tried to illustrate the relative sizes of migrant populations using the lengths of the sector axis, transitioning between\n The number of migrants (which is a combination of migrant living in the region and migrants born in the region living elsewhere) as in the plots above, and The total population of the region.  The chord widths remain constant, fixed at the size of the bilateral migrant populations.\n\r\nRefugee populations relative to total migrant populations In the final plots I illustrate the relative sizes of forced migrant populations compared to the total migrant populations, transitioning the chords between\n The number of migrants from each origin and destination based on the UN IMS2020 stock data The number of forced migrants from each origin and destination based on data from UNHCR  In the first version the sector axis remain constant, fixed at the size of the bilateral migrant populations in each region.\n\rIn the second plot the sector axis vary to match the type of migrants (all migrants or forced migrants) so show the relative differences in patterns.\n\rR Code These plots were all produced in R, primarily using the chordDiagram() function in the circlize package. A while ago I wrote a post with details on creating animated chord diagrams. The specific code for the plots above gets a bit overwhelming (and is poorly commented) so I am hesitant to put it online, especially because the more complicated parts for defining the lines for the global regions can now be done much more easily using the new group argument in the chordDiagram() function, as described in a recent post by the circlize package creator Zuguang Gu.\n","date":1592611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592611200,"objectID":"dd3291e74bb335d3a9328f543981b270","permalink":"https://guyabel.com/post/global-migrant-chord-diagrams/","publishdate":"2020-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/global-migrant-chord-diagrams/","section":"post","summary":"Over the last year or so I have been playing around with different ways of showing changing global bilateral migrant stocks, adapting the animation code I created for the plots for region to region flows in this estimation paper.","tags":null,"title":"Global migrant populations visualized using animated chord diagrams ","type":"post"},{"authors":["Guy J.

As all the estimates were based on WPP2017 our claim for the estimates being based on the most up to date input data was only true for around 24 hours.\nIn order to keep the estimates a bit more current I have added new version based on the WPP2019 to the Figshare collection. Below is a quick summary of the changes in the updated estimates to those in the paper.\nComparison to past estimates based on WPP2017 and WPP2019 The plot below shows the relationship between the bilateral flow estimates based on WPP2017 and WPP2019 from each period and estimation method.\nFor the stock differencing methods there are no changes in the estimates. They do not rely on WPP data. The migration rates approach uses the total absolute net migration data from WPP. All bilateral flows from WPP2019 are slightly higher than their WPP2017 counterparts, though it is barely noticeable in the plot above. The demographic accounting methods use the birth, death and population estimates from the WPP. In each method there are some sizable differences for the flows generated by updated revisions to the WPP demographic data, in particular for those based on the closed demographic accounting approach.\nThese difference results in revisions to the overall totals of migration flows. Below is an animation of the changes to Figure 2 in the paper\nFrom this plot it is easier to see the changes in the migration rates estimation method. I was surprised that the changes in the estimates were occurring in all periods, not just the most recent period (2010-2015). To investigate I took a look at the changes in the WPP data.\nWhich countries are most affected? The countries where the largest changes in the bilateral estimates occurred (from the closed demographic accounting methods) can be detected by looking at the revisions in net migration between WPP2017 and WPP2019. Net migration is the best measure to track their changes as it correlates perfectly with the net migration in the WPP and is the residual of the input data (births, deaths and population) for the estimates based on the demographic accounting methods. Below are the changes in the complete time series of net migration in nine countries where the largest absolute differences (in any period) between the two WPP versions occur.\nAt first, I was a bit surprised by the scale of the changes. In some periods the revisions to net migration are greater than a million. I dug a little deeper into net migration in previous WPP revisions to find that similar revisions are not unusual. Below are the revisions of absolute net migration between past WPP versions that exceed one million (back to WPP2000, the earliest WPP data I can get my hands on).\n\r{\"x\":{\"url\":\"index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-2.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\rImpact on validation exercise The impact of the revision in WPP data on the validation exercise in the paper is minimal. Below is an update of Figure 4 in the paper.\nThe correlations change by few hundredths of a decimal. These small changes, despite what is shown in the first plot above, are due to the limited amount of reported migration flows statistics (at the global level) to carry out our validation exercise. In the 45 countries that we used (based on the United Nations Population Division collection) the revisions in the WPP data were relatively minor, hence only small changes in their estimates and the correlations with the reported data.\n\nVersion 3: Update for IMS2019 Another update in the input data came out a few weeks back - this time the UN International Migrant Stock (IMS) data. I have added another set of flow estimates based on the IMS2019 and WPP2019 to the Figshare collection (the original flow estimates in the paper were based on IMS2017). I do not expect there will not be a need to update the estimates again until at least 2021.\nBelow are a few plots to give some visual summaries of the changes in the updated estimates to those in the paper and from the last update.\nComparison to past estimates The plot below shows the relationship between the bilateral flow estimates based on IMS2017 and WPP2017 (as in the paper) and IMS2019 - WPP2019 (this update) from each period and estimation method.\nIn all methods (columns) there are changes some the estimates, which tend to be larger in more recent periods (lower rows) and estimation methods based on demographic accounting (columns to the right). These patterns are likely due to larger revisions in the most recent stock data and the use of updated demographic data in the demographic accounting methods - not required in the stock differencing approaches.\nThe revisions to the overall totals of migration flows, shown in Figure 2 in the paper, are animated below, transitioning from 1) the estimates in the paper to 2) the first update of the estimates from changes in the demographic data to 3) the most recent update for changes in the stock data.\nThe 2010-2015 estimates are, on the whole, suggesting that the total global flows remained at similar levels to 2005-2010. Earlier versions of the estimates had suggested a decline. As a result the crude global migration rate falls by only a small margin for most estimation methods during 2010-2015, except for Pseudo-Bayesian estimates of flows where the rate increases a touch.\nWhich countries are most affected? The largest changes in the bilateral flow estimates can be partially detected by looking at the revisions in migrant stock data between IMS2017 and IMS2019. In the stock differencing methods these changes are directly related to the change in the estimated flow sizes between the bilateral country pair. In the demographic accounting approaches the impact of the revision is less direct on the estimated flows, as each method allows for return and on-wards migration to match changes in migrant stock data. Below is scatter plot of the changes in the IMS data by continent.\nThere are a few features to note. First, and unsurprisingly, the largest revisions are occurring in the most recent data (2015). Second, the biggest changes are in North American data sources. Below is a table of the bilateral pairs where the revision to the migrant stocks is greater than 100,000. Third, in some areas there are noticeable patterns to the changes - the diagonal lines parallel to the \\(y=x\\) line - which I guess is related to updates in the data used to imputation missing bilateral stocks.\n\r{\"x\":{\"url\":\"index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-4.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\rImpact on validation exercise The impact of the revision in stock data on the validation exercise in the paper is slightly larger than the previous update, but still not very dramatic. Below is an animated version of Figure 4 in the paper, showing the correlations between the flow estimates and reported data for various migration measures, for the original estimates and subsequent updates based on new WPP and IMS data.\nAs with the first update, the small changes in the correlations, despite some large revisions in the migrant stock data are due to the limited amount of reported migration flows statistics (at the global level) to carry out our validation exercise.\n\nVersion 4: Correct for Serbia, Montenegro, Sudan and South Sudan before 2005 In the original paper, and updates described above, both Serbia and Montenegro, and Sudan and South Sudan are treated as separate countries through the entire 1990 to 2015 period. This was not a great choice. Although the UN provide separate demographic and migrant stock data for each of the four countries back to 1990, the notes in the migrant stock spreadsheet (number 4 and 24) point out that the foreign-born data for Sudan and Serbia before 2005 cover South Sudan and Montenegro respectively. In both South Sudan and Montenegro before 2005 there is no data provided for the foreign-born populations.\nThe differences in geographic coverage of Sudan and Serbia in the migrant stock data has an impact on the flow estimates that are based on the differences in stocks. For example, the demographic accounting-based methods were trying to calibrate changes in foreign born stocks (from zero in 1990 to zero in 1995 for example) in South Sudan and Montenegro with a non-zero net migration over the period. This was resolved in the background by some parts of the IPF code running until their default iteration limit rather than until convergence, where convergence was not feasible. I picked up on this when adding some new warning messages in the ffs_demo() function of the migest package which should now alert users for non-convergence.\nTo rectify this problem, I have created a new version of the estimates that treat Serbia and Montenegro, and Sudan and South Sudan, as single countries before 2010-2015. This reduces the number of countries in the earlier periods of the data to 198, there is still 200 countries, and the estimates are the same as in the previous update. I use the SCG and SUD country codes for Serbia and Montenegro and Sudan before 2010-2015, and the four separate country codes during 2010-2015 and after (SRB, MNE, SDN, SSD as in previous versions).\nI have added a few plots below to once again give some summaries of the changes in the updated estimates to those in the paper and from the last update.\nComparison to past estimates The plot below shows the relationship between the bilateral flow estimates based on the last update based on IMS2019 and WPP2019 and the newer estimates with the correction for the four countries.\nImpact on validation exercise The impact of the correction for the four countries on the validation exercise is very minor. Below is an animated version of Figure 4 in the paper, showing the correlations between the flow estimates and reported data for various migration measures, for the original estimates, the previous updates based on new WPP and IMS data and the new estimates with a correction for the four countries prior to 2010-2015.\n\nVersion 5: Update for IMS2020 The new UN International Migrant Stock (IMS) data came out a few weeks back. I have added another set of flow estimates based on the IMS2020 and WPP2019 to the Figshare collection (the original flow estimates in the paper were based on IMS2017). As the IMS2020 contain bilateral stocks for 2020, it was possible to generate a first set of flow estimates for the 2015-2020 period, show at the end of the animation below for estimates basd on one of the methods covered in the paper:\n\rvideo {\r/* override other styles to make responsive */\rwidth: 100% !important;\rheight: auto !important;\rmax-height: 720px\r}\r\r\rBelow are a few plots to give some visual summaries of the changes in the estimates compared to previous versions.\nComparison to past estimates The plot of the totals migration flows, shown in Figure 2 in the paper, is updated below with the new estimates, including the new values for the 2015-2020.\nThe estimates in the new 2015-2020 period see a continued slow in the growth of total flows based on estimates using the Pseudo-Bayesian method. The other demographic accounting methods also see a small increase in the estimated total flows during 2015-2020 from 2010-2015. There is a noticeable decline in the total flows during 2015-2020 estimated using the rates approach and incline from the stock differencing methods. I suspect all the estimates for 2015-2020 will see some major changes from future revisions of the IMS data, as data drips in from the 2020 round of censuses that will alter the stocks and demographic used as input data to estimate flows in the most recent periods.\nThe evolution of the changes in the estimates from different revisions in the input data can be seen below; transitioning from 1) the estimates in the paper to 2) the first update (version 2) of the estimates from changes in the demographic data to 3) the second update for changes in the stock data (version 4) to the most recent update (version 5, the same as the plot above).\nImpact on validation exercise The impact of the revision in stock data on the validation exercise in the paper is still relatively minor. Below is an update of the animated version of Figure 4 in the paper, showing the correlations between the flow estimates and reported data for various migration measures, for the original estimates and subsequent updates based on new WPP and IMS data.\nAs with the other updates, the small changes in the correlations, despite some large revisions in the migrant stock data are due to the limited amount of reported migration flows statistics (at the global level) to carry out our validation exercise. The estimates during 2015-2020 have no influence due to the lack of corresponding reported flow data in the UN collection.\n\nVersion 6: Update for WPP2022 The new UN World Population Prospects (WPP) data came out a few months back. I have added another set of flow estimates based on the IMS2020 and WPP2022 to the Figshare collection (the original flow estimates in the paper were based on IMS2017 and WPP2017). The WPP2022 contain data on births and deaths in many more countries (mostly small countries and territories) than previous versions, allowing estimates of migration flows between 229 countries, compared to the 200 in previous versions.\nTowards the start of this year our paper based on sex-specific flow estimates was published in Scientific Data. The updated flow estimates based on the WPP2022 data, also expanded to 229 countries, are in a separate Figshare collection.\nThe WPP data are now annual, running between 1st January and 31st December for each measure. This differs to the migrant stock data that are aligned at the 1st July in five-year intervals. Consequently, I had to do some extra coding to interpolate the WPP2022 demographic data to five-year summary measures that match the intervals in the migrant stock data and obtain the five-year flow estimates.\nBelow are a few plots to give some visual summaries of the new estimates and their changes relative to previous versions alongside some discussion, starting with an animated chord diagram of the updated region to region flow estimates over time:\n\rvideo {\r/* override other styles to make responsive */\rwidth: 100% !important;\rheight: auto !important;\rmax-height: 720px\r}\r\r\rComparison to past estimates The plot of the totals migration flows, shown in Figure 2 in the paper, is updated below with the new estimates, including the 30 odd extra new countries included in the estimates from the expanded data availability in WPP2022 input data.\nThe evolution of the changes in the estimates from different revisions in the input data can be seen below; transitioning from 1) the estimates in the paper to 2) the first update (version 2) of the estimates from changes in the demographic data to 3) the second and third updates for changes in the stock data (version 4 and 5) to the 5) most recent update (version 6, the same as the plot above).\nThe latest rise in the level of the estimates from the demographic accounting and migration rates methods are a result of two big changes 1) the expanded set of countries and 2) some dramatic revisions in the birth, death and population data in WPP2022 compared to WPP2019. The changes in the demographic data and their impact on the estimated migration flows can be best viewed from inspecting the biggest changes in net migration between WPP2019 and WPP2022.\nSome of the revisions in net migration are on a much larger scale than the previous changes between WPP2017 and WPP2019. Pakistan, where the largest revision occurs, has a net migration loss in WPP2022 of over 7 million in the last two five-year periods. In WPP2019 in the same periods the net migration loss was just over 1 million. I am not sure if the revised WPP2022 values are plausible? In any case, these revisions have big impacts for the bilateral flow estimates, especially those based on the closed demographic accounting methods which are implicitly constrained to match the WPP net migration.\nImpact on validation exercise The impact of the revision in WPP data on the validation exercises is more pronounced than in any other updates so far. Below is an update of the animated version of Figure 4 in the paper, showing the correlations between the flow estimates and reported data for various migration measures, for the original estimates and subsequent updates based on new WPP and IMS data.\nThere biggest changes are the drops in the correlations for the estimates based on demographic accounting approaches, especially in the immigration and emigration rate measures. The general ordering of preferences between the estimates from different methods, based on the highest levels of correlation, remain unchanged.\n","date":1560729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560729600,"objectID":"def464f1649484d04f5877bea1ade044","permalink":"https://guyabel.com/publication/bilateral-international-migration-flow-estimates/","publishdate":"2019-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bilateral-international-migration-flow-estimates/","section":"publication","summary":"Data on stocks and flows of international migration are necessary to understand migrant patterns and trends and to monitor and evaluate migration-relevant international development agendas. Many countries do not publish data on bilateral migration flows. At least six methods have been proposed recently to estimate bilateral migration flows between all origin-destination country pairs based on migrant stock data published by the World Bank and United Nations. We apply each of these methods to the latest available stock data to provide six estimates of five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2015. To assess the resulting estimates, we correlate estimates of six migration measures from each method with equivalent reported data where possible. Such systematic efforts at validation have largely been neglected thus far. We show that the correlation between the reported data and the estimates varies widely among different migration measures, over space, and over time. We find that the two methods using a closed demographic accounting approach perform consistently better than the four other estimation approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Bilateral international migration flow estimates for 200 countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

Exploiting bilateral data on asylum seeking applications for 157 countries over the period 2006–2015, we assess the determinants of refugee flows using a gravity model which accounts for endogenous selection in order to examine the causal link between climate, conflict and forced migration. Our results indicate that climatic conditions, by affecting drought severity and the likelihood of armed conflict, played a significant role as an explanatory factor for asylum seeking in the period 2011–2015. The effect of climate on conflict occurrence is particularly relevant for countries in Western Asia in the period 2010–2012 during when many countries were undergoing political transformation. This finding suggests that the impact of climate on conflict and asylum seeking flows is limited to specific time period and contexts.","tags":null,"title":"Climate, Conflict and Forced Migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guy Abel"],"categories":["R","migration","chord-diagram"],"content":"During the last few months I have given some introductory talks on international migration in Asia and Europe.

We find that (1) collaboration among demographers has increased over the past 10 years, however, among co-authored papers, collaboration across institutions remains relatively unchanged over the period, (2) papers based on core demographic subfields such as fertility, mortality, migration and data and methods are more likely to involve multiple authors and (3) multiple author teams that are all female are less likely to co-author with colleagues in different institutions.

It also shows how the assumption making has evolved to cover a longer period (up to 2100 from WPP2010 on-wards) and the use of the long run zero net migration trajectory, an assumption that seems to me to be overly complex given we know nothing about migration in the long run.\nThe second plot slices the past data and future assumption a different way - looking at revisions in the WPP for each continent. These plots are similar to those that Shaw (2007) used to illustrate assumption drift in the ONS national population projections.\nThe assumptions in the past WPP also exhibit some drift, with assumptions for future net migration commonly immediately turning towards lower levels - where later observed estimates go on to show that a persistence assumption (without the turning point) would have been more accurate - see for example Africa or Europe.\n","date":1526428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526428800,"objectID":"128b21bd4e0bb0793ffef99b02510143","permalink":"https://guyabel.com/publication/non-zero-ssp-net-migration-projections/","publishdate":"2018-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/non-zero-ssp-net-migration-projections/","section":"publication","summary":"Little attention is given to the role of migration in global population projection models.

In this paper we develop future long-run migration scenarios to provide a range of possible outcomes. Our alternative migration scenarios are linked to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), widely used in research on global environmental change. These are utilized as inputs for a global cohort component projection model to obtain population totals up until 2100 for all countries.

For such comparisons, Zuguang Gu suggests scaling the gaps between the sectors on the outside of the chord diagram. I wrote a little function that can do this for flow data arranged in a tidy format;\nscale_gap \u0026lt;- function(flow_m, flow_max, gap_at_max = 1, gaps = NULL) {\rp \u0026lt;- flow_m / flow_max\rif(length(gap_at_max) == 1 \u0026amp; !is.null(gaps)) {\rgap_at_max \u0026lt;- rep(gap_at_max, gaps)\r}\rgap_degree \u0026lt;- (360 - sum(gap_at_max)) * (1 - p)\rgap_m \u0026lt;- (gap_degree + sum(gap_at_max))/gaps\rreturn(gap_m)\r}\r where\n flow_m is the size of total flows in the matrix for the given year being re-scaled. flow_max is the maximum size of the flow matrix over all years gap_at_max is the size in degrees of the gaps in the flow matrix in the year where the flows are at their all time maximum. gaps is the number of gaps in the chord diagram (i.e. the number of regions).  The function can be used to derive the size of gaps in each frame for a new animation.\nd3 \u0026lt;- d2 %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(.frame) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarise(flow = sum(flow)) %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(gaps = scale_gap(flow_m = flow, flow_max = max(.$flow), gap_at_max = 4, gaps = 9))\rd3\r ## # A tibble: 101 × 3\r## .frame flow gaps\r## \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 0 17.6 25.9\r## 2 1 17.8 25.7\r## 3 2 18.1 25.6\r## 4 3 18.3 25.4\r## 5 4 18.5 25.2\r## 6 5 18.7 25.1\r## 7 6 18.9 24.9\r## 8 7 19.1 24.7\r## 9 8 19.3 24.6\r## 10 9 19.6 24.4\r## # … with 91 more rows\r The calculations in d3 can then be plugged into the for loop above, where the circos.par() function is replaced by\ncircos.par(start.degree = 90, track.margin = c(-0.1, 0.1),\rgap.degree = filter(d3, .frame == f)$gaps, points.overflow.warning = FALSE)\r Once the for loop has produced a new set of images, the same code to produce previous animation can be run to obtain the animated chord diagrams with changing gaps;\n Whilst the sector axes are now fixed, I am not convinced that changing the relative gaps is the best way to compare volumes when using animated chord diagrams. The sectors of all regions - bar Northern America - are rotating making it hard follow their changes over time.\nFortunately there is new xmax option in chordDiagram that can be used to fix the lengths of the x-axis for each sector using a named vector.

If places and populations are not vulnerable, or susceptible, to climate change, then the climate-migration relationship may not materialize. The key to understanding and, from a policy perspective, planning for whether and how climate change will impact future migration patterns is therefore knowledge of the link between climate vulnerability and migration. However, beyond specific case studies, little is known about this association in global perspective. We therefore provide a descriptive, country-level portrait of this relationship. We show that the negative association between climate vulnerability and international migration holds only for countries least vulnerable to climate change, which suggests the potential for trapped populations in more vulnerable countries. However, when analyzed separately by life supporting sector (food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure) and vulnerability dimension (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), we detect evidence of a relationship among more, but not the most, vulnerable countries. The bilateral (i.e., country-to-country) migration show that, on average, people move from countries of higher vulnerability to lower vulnerability, reducing global risk by 15%. This finding is consistent with the idea that migration is a climate adaptation strategy.
